# Architecture overview

## Purpose

Briefly describe what this Terraform module provides, the problem it solves, and intended audiences.

## High-level diagram

Add an ASCII/PNG/SVG diagram showing major components and integrations (cloud provider resources, networks, IAM, external systems).

## Components

- Resources created (e.g., VPC, subnets, security groups, managed services)
- Logical grouping and responsibilities

## Inputs / Outputs (summary)

- Key inputs and why they exist (example: `env`, `region`, `cidr_block`)
- Key outputs consumers should use

## Security & Compliance

- Secrets handling recommendations
- IAM least-privilege notes
- Network isolation / network policies

## Deployment & Usage

- Typical usage snippet
- State backend recommendations
- Versioning and upgrade considerations

## Scaling & Resilience

- Expected scaling model and limits
- Multi-region / availability considerations

## Testing & Validation

- Unit tests, integration tests, static checks (terraform fmt, validate, tflint, tfsec)
- CI/CD pipeline expectations

## Decisions & Trade-offs

Record important architecture decisions and rationale (links to ADRs if present).

## Maintenance & Ownership

- Maintainers and SLAs
- Release process and breaking change policy

## Troubleshooting

Common failure modes and where to look (logs, cloud console, terraform plan/apply tips).

## References

- Links to relevant docs, ADRs, PRs, tickets, and external services.

(Replace placeholders with project-specific details and a diagram.)
